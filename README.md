# Unity3DSandboxGame
Demo game for Unity 3D Sandbox game.  Demo various movement, shooting, navigation and object behaviors.

As a teacher, I like to have some sample code for use by my students.  Well documented to the concepts you need to understand are explained.

I will be adding to this Repository as I go further, and adding lesson documentation to aid in understanding concepts as they are introduced.

Can be used as a reference for others to use to learn how to make Unity games.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
